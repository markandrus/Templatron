<p><strong>Kristen Jacobson </strong>is Assistant Professor in the Department&nbsp; of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at The University of Chicago.

Her phenotypic work has focused primarily on applying ecological models to studies of children and adolescents to determine whether the importance of risk and protective factors varies across different contexts. Her behavioral genetic work has primarily been focused on: 1) the importance of genes and environments on individual differences over the life course; 2) whether there is genetic heterogeneity of antisocial behavior; and 3) gene X environment interactions. Newer research interests concern the underlying neurobiology of aggression and antisocial behavior, and the capacity of environmental experiences to alter biological and genetic effects.</p>
