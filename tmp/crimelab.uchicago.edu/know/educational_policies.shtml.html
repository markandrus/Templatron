<p>For years the debate about crime policy in America pitted law enforcement strategies against education or social policies designed to address "root causes."  But there is no reason that these need be mutually exclusive strategies for addressing the problem of crime and violence.</p>
<p>Why might education policies help prevent crime?  Criminologists believe poverty and social inequality might contribute to crime in part by fueling feelings of jealousy and frustration.  An influential 1968 paper by Nobel laureate Gary Becker of the University of Chicago argues that improved schooling attainment and labor market prospects reduce crime by increasing the "opportunity costs" of illegal activity.</p>
<p>Whatever the underlying mechanism, we now have good empirical evidence to support the idea that more schooling reduces criminal involvement, thanks to a study by Lance Lochner of the University of Western Ontario and Enrico Moretti of UC-Berkeley <a title="[ PDF ]" href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~moretti/lm46.pdf">that uses state compulsory schooling laws as a natural experiment to identify causal schooling effect</a>.  This in turn raises the question of whether we know much about which policy levers are actually capable of improving children's schooling outcomes.</p>
<p>Nobel laureate James Heckman of the University of Chicago has been a leading proponent of <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w14695">increased spending on early childhood interventions as a cost-effective way to improve children's schooling outcomes and long-term life chances</a>.  A growing body of research in neuroscience, developmental psychology, economics, program evaluation, and even animal studies suggests that children may be unusually "plastic" and malleable during the earliest years of life.  The developmental quality of home and neighborhood environments seem to differ substantially across race and class lines during these earliest years of life, with the <a title="[ PDF ]" href="http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/FryerLevittUnderstandingTheBlack2004.pdf">result being large disparities across children in early reading and math skills even before children reach school entry age</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the most striking empirical evidence about the potential benefits of early intervention come from the long-term evaluation of Perry Preschool, an intensive but small-scale early childhood experimental program launched in the 1960s for disadvantaged African American children in Ypsilanti, Michigan.  Children have now been followed through age 40,<a href="http://www.highscope.org/Content.asp?ContentId=219	"> with large differences between the program and no-program groups in arrest rates as well as schooling attainment and other outcomes</a>.&nbsp; A benefit-cost analysis of Perry suggests the program may generate up to nearly $13 in benefits for every $1 spent on the program, <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/jhr/2006ab/belfield1.htm">with the vast majority of these benefits due to reductions in criminal behavior among males</a>.  Assigning dollar values to the social costs of crime is an inherently uncertain exercise, but nevertheless the benefit-cost figures that have been calculated for Perry Preschool are extremely impressive by any standard.  The main limitation of the Perry Preschool study is that it is a very small, very intensive model program, and so the Perry results may not generalize to larger-scale programs such as Head Start.  It is possible for instance that the teachers hired for the Perry demonstration may have been unusually talented or dedicated, and that recruiting teachers of a uniformly similar quality would be difficult with a version of Perry that operated on a nationwide scale.</p>
<p>Natural experiment-style studies of Head Start<a title="[ PDF ]" href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~ludwigj/papers/QJE_Headstart_2007.pdf"> suggest that program also generates lasting gains in educational attainment to children who participated in the program during its first few decades</a>, which by virtue of the Lochner and Moretti study mentioned above leads us to suspect beneficial impacts on criminal behavior as well.  A <a title="[ PDF ]" href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~ludwigj/papers/SRCD_Headstart_2007.pdf">recent randomized experimental evaluation of Head Start's impacts on recent cohorts of children finds short-term test score impacts</a> that may be similar to what were observed among children who participated in the 1960s and 1970s.  While Head Start does not generate impacts on children that are as large as what we see with Perry Preschool, Head Start also costs only about half as much.  While there are some limitations with the evidence that is currently available, it seems likely that Head Start generates benefits to society that outweigh program costs.</p>
<p>Several evaluation studies have also identified effective strategies for improving the quality of children's elementary school environments.  One way to do this is by reducing average class sizes, which may enable teachers to provide more individualized support or instruction to students. Experimental studies of class-size reduction from the "Tennessee STAR" program suggest that smaller classes during the early grades of elementary school may also generate lasting impacts on children, including higher achievement test scores and, somewhat less clear, perhaps even some signs of a decline in criminal behavior.  Crime Lab member Diane Schanzenbach has written <a title="[ PDF ]" href="http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/About/publications/working-papers/pdf/wp_06_06.pdf">an excellent review of this evidence</a>. For policy purposes it is important to note that the Tennessee STAR program reduced class sizes while holding teacher quality constant.  More recent research on California's statewide class size reduction policy suggests that reducing class sizes on a larger scale could have the <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w9205">unintended consequence of reducing the average quality of classroom teachers, particularly in urban school systems serving disproportionately disadvantaged student populations</a>.</p>
<p>A different strategy for improving elementary school instruction is to change instructional practices directly.  One of the more promising interventions seems to be Success for All (SFA), a comprehensive whole-school reform model that operates in more than 1,200 mostly high-poverty Title I schools. SFA focuses on reading, with an emphasis on prevention and early intervention.  Children receive 90 minutes each day of reading instruction in groups that are organized across grade levels based on each child's current reading level, which helps teachers to target instruction. Students engage in cooperative learning exercises in which they discuss stories or learn from each other, which helps reinforce what teachers do and build social skills. Children are assessed at eight-week intervals, using both formal measures of reading competency and teacher observations. Children who fall behind are given extra tutoring or help with other problems, such as health or behavior problems.  A random assignment evaluation of SFA documented that at the end of three years, students in the treatment schools scored roughly 0.2 standard deviations higher than students in the control schools on a standardized reading assessment.  These effects were<a title="[ DOC ]" href="http://www.successforall.net/_images/pdfs/Borman%20Rand%20Eval%20of%20SFA%20II%20to%20AERJ%20FINAL%2009%2022%2006.doc"> equivalent to about one-fifth the gap between low and high socioeconomic-status children</a>.  SFA costs about $950 per student per year.  Current spending under the federal government's Title I program is around $880 per eligible student, and that there is little evidence that Title I funding as typically deployed by public schools translates into much gain in student learning. One implication is that in schools serving predominantly poor students, SFA could be implemented mostly by just redeploying existing Title I funds.</p>
<p>Since schools and center-based care for children is so expensive, we are also encouraged that research by Patrick Tolan, Deborah Gorman-Smith and their colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago have found that family-based counseling programs also seem to be effective in addressing risk factors among young children that predict future involvement with risky or anti-social behaviors.  For example a randomized experimental study of the SAFE Children program found that a 20-session multiple-family group intervention and weekly tutoring assistance for low-income inner-city children has <a href="http://www.psych.uic.edu/research/safe.htm">some positive effect on reading achievement test scores, parental involvement in school, and parenting practices</a>.</p>
<p>Less is currently known about how to improve schooling outcomes for older children, particularly high school students who are in or near the peak ages for criminal offending.  The most rigorous evaluation of a high school reform model is MDRC's random assignment study of Career Academies, which are organized as small learning communities of between 150 and 200 high school students (often housed within larger, comprehensive high schools) that focus on a specific occupation or industry.  Unlike the vocational education programs that were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, career academies combine academic and technical curriculum, often using the technical curricula relevant to a particular industry to motivate students.  One hallmark of these programs is to establish a connection with employers in the given field, which occurs through mentors and internships of students with local employers.  Early results of the Career Academy evaluation indicated that the program raised attendance and completion of course credits in the early years of high school.  A later follow-up <a href="http://www.mdrc.org/project_29_1.html">found no differences in high school completion rates between program and control groups, but did find a substantial impact on earnings among high-risk students</a>.</p><!-- /com.omniupdate.div -->
